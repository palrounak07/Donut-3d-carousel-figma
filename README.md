Donut – 3D Carousel Figma Animation 🎡✨

This repository features a creative Figma prototype showcasing a 3D carousel interaction designed for modern, visually engaging user interfaces. The concept blends depth, smooth motion, and playful animation to deliver a delightful browsing experience.

🗂️ Project Overview

The Donut 3D Carousel concept focuses on:

🎠 3D Rotational Layout: A donut-style carousel that creates an illusion of depth and smooth circular movement.

🎨 Modern UI Exploration: A clean, minimal visual approach designed to highlight motion and product visibility.

⚙️ Smart Micro-Interactions: Carefully crafted animations that make navigation feel natural and dynamic.

🧩 Prototype-First Design: Built entirely in Figma to explore what’s possible using Smart Animate and layered transitions.

This project serves as a creative exploration of animation-driven UI, pushing Figma’s limits to create immersive, interactive experiences.

🚀 Highlights

🌟 Visually Engaging Motion: Smooth rotation, depth simulation, and fluid transitions.

📦 Concept-Driven UI: Designed as a showcase for modern product carousels and interactive showcases.

🧠 Design Thinking Approach: Focused on usability, visual hierarchy, and attention-guiding motion.

📌 Inspiration-Ready: Useful for designers exploring animation techniques, 3D illusions, and prototype-heavy workflows.
